                    <p>Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of technologies such as solar power to generate electricity, solar thermal energy (including solar water heating), and solar architecture. It is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power, and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.</p>

                    <p> Hydropower  also known as water power This is achieved by converting the gravitational potential or kinetic energy of a water source to produce power Hydropower is a method of sustainable energy production. Hydropower is now used principally for hydroelectric power generation, and is also applied as one half of an energy storage system known as pumped-storage hydroelectricity. Hydropower is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels as it does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other atmospheric pollutants and it provides a relatively consistent source of power. Nonetheless, it has economic, sociological, and environmental downsides and requires a sufficiently energetic source of water, such as a river or elevated lake. International institutions such as the World Bank view hydropower as a low-carbon means for economic development.</p>

                    <p>Thermal energy (also called heat energy) is produced when a rise in temperature causes atoms and molecules to move faster and collide with each other.The energy that comes from the temperature of the heated substance is called thermal energy.The molecules and atoms that make up matter are moving all the time. When a substance heats up, the rise in temperature makes these particles move faster and bump into each other.
Thermal energy is the energy that comes from the heated up substance. The hotter the substance, the more its particles move, and the higher its thermal energy.Thermal energy is produced when the atoms and molecules in a substance vibrate faster due to a rise in temperature.</p>

                    <a href="#" class="blog-title">Natural Gas</a>
                    <p>Natural gas is a non-renewable fossil fuel formed from the remains of tiny sea plants and animals that died 300-400 million years ago. Approximately 90% of natural gas is composed of methane, but it also contains other gases such as propane and butane.
                        300-400 million years ago, the remains of tiny sea plants and animals sank to the bottom of the oceans, where they were buried by sediment that turned into rock.

                        Over the years, the layers of rock became thousands of feet thick, putting the energy-rich plant and animal matter under a lot of pressure. Eventually, the pressure and heat changed this organic mixture into oil (petroleum) and natural gas.
                        
                        Natural gas became trapped in the rock layers – much like water is trapped in a wet sponge.

                    <p>Nuclear energy comes from the nucleus of atoms. The energy is released by nuclear fusion (nuclei are fused together) or nuclear fission (nuclei are split apart). Nuclear plants use nuclear fission of a radioactive element called uranium to generate electricity.
                        Atoms – the particles that make up every object in the universe – consist of neutrons, protons and electrons. They contain a nucleus, which is where nuclear energy comes from.

                        Nuclear energy is released from an atom through either:
                        
                        *Nuclear fusion, when nuclei of atoms are combined or fused together. This is how the Sun produces energy.
                        *Nuclear fission, when nuclei of atoms are split apart. This is the method used by nuclear plants to generate electricity.

                    <p>Coal is a fossil fuel. It comes from the remains of plants that died about 100 to 400 million years ago. Coal is a non-renewable energy source because it takes millions of years to form.Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.</p>
